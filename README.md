# Spotify Clone

This is a **Spotify Clone** application where users can sign in with Google OAuth, connect their Spotify account, and enjoy a limited version of Spotify's features, such as searching for music, creating playlists, and saving songs. The application uses a modern stack with React, Redux, and Vite for a fast and smooth experience.
